      <h4>Stress Suspension Study</h4>
      <p>The Stress Suspension study is a biofeedback intervention program that utilizes a biofeedback device, the Pip, in order to decrease middle school students&apos; stress and increase their resiliency with behavioral and academic issues. By measuring electrodermal activity, the Pip device allows students to see how their bodies respond to stress. The device connects to three biofeedback Apps that visually display the students&apos; stress levels in order to help students learn to recognize and reduce their stress and monitor the effectiveness of their stress management training. This project is being implemented as a four-week program with students at Farmville Middle School and will triangulate data using physiological, psychological, and academic assessments. Programs for adolescents such as this are needed in order to positively impact students&apos; emotional well-being, academic performance, development, and overall quality of life.</p>

      <h4>Mobile TeleHealth</h4>
      <p>The Mobile Telehealth project is a grant from the Department of Defense that looks at decreasing hyper-arousal nervous system activity and achieving a state of balance. The use of mobile technology will be employed to deliver biofeedback training to soldiers at various locations in the field.</p>

      <h4>Mobile Naturalistic Cognitive Assessment</h4>
      <p>The mobile Naturalistic Cognitive Assessment (mNCA) is a development project aimed at designing an enjoyable psychometric assessment that can be used in the field on a mobile device. This game is built on a series of psychological tests that score the user&apos;s performance. These scores can be related to a number of health conditions. The first research study using this technology explores how these indicators can predict the severity of a traumatic brain injury in Marines at Camp Lejeune.</p>

    <div class="rt_div">
      <h4>Marksmanship Study</h4>
      <p>The marksmanship study focuses on testing the effects of biofeedback tools on marksmanship of the ECU ROTC. The marksmanship study implements a randomized comparison design to better characterize the role of psychophysiology in task execution. Marksmanship requires a high level of attention, fine motor control, and alert immobility. These traits may be strongly influenced by the Central Autonomic Network. Therefore, heart rate variability training may improve marksmanship. The marksmanship study explores this possibility.</p>

    <div class="rt_div">
      <h4>Casual Video Game Research</h4>
      <p>The research studies examining the positive effects of Casual Video Game (CVG) play on short term and over a one-month period from a psychophysiological and biochemical perspective. Results have demonstrated that prescribed CVG play can significantly improve mood and decrease stress, as well as decrease clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety. A current project is examining the effects of prescribed CVG play added to a medication regimen on clinical depression and co-morbid anxiety.</p>
